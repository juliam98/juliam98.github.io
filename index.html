        <h2>About this page</h2>

                <div class="center">
                    <p>Basically, in a classic ADHD move, I created this page because one time I was attending a very boring online training and the deficit in dopamine has somehow lead me to distract myself with making Notion widgets, what later evolved into me this making of this website (it was a really long training).</p>
                    <p>So basically I don't know any HTML or CSS, I am figuiring it all out as I go, so you'll have to bear with me.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime, here is me as a child with my aunt's parakeet named <abbr title="Augmentative of mysz; a big or ugly mouse (polish)">Mycha</abbr>.</p>
