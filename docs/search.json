I started learning python too, since it has wide range of applications, even though I was not convinced by the array indexing starting at 0 (I’m still not convinced).\nI learned R for statistical analyses, because I was absolutely fed up with SPSS, and I did not know Julia existed yet. The ever shifting figures in the word format of my undergraduate thesis pushed me to learn LaTeX. I learnt the basics of HTML and CSS when I started working on this website.\nDuring my MSc and PhD I learnt bash scripting, which I think is so much fun.\nThis is pretty much all I know- bits of many languages, but most at a very very basic level."
